# Undergrad-Assignments-and-Projects
All the programming concepts that I have learned up till now are in Assignments , Projects and Practice LAB's.

<b>All the Resources</b><br>
:books: <b>COAL - (Assembly Language compiler)<b> : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G2eLcdFQZhG1MnL0zm00wPfUHjIlQ6Yk?usp=sharing <br><br>
:pencil: <b>Instructions for Installing</b>
1. Hover over to <b>Top Right</b> of the screen and click on "DOWNLOAD ALL"
2. Extract the files.
3. Open the file named "instructions-for-dosbox.docx" and follow the instructions --> (Window Users)<br>
4. Open the "Mac_instructions.PNG" and follow the instructions --> (Mac/Linux Users)<br>
<pre>I would personally suggest to go for Windows Installation because I have used it personally and works perfectly fine</pre>
