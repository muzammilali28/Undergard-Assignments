//Working IDE's
-> This code works on Visual Studio 2013 (That I have tested till yet)

//How to RUN
-> Make an input file with name "file.txt".
-> Enter data in the file in format of Rows and Colums.

::file.txt::
4 5 6 8 9  //Row 0
3 5 8 9    //Row 1
2 1 2      //Row 2
1 7        //Row 3

-> Cope paste the (main.cpp) code in your coding file having ".cpp" extension
-> Save your ".cpp" file.
-> Paste your "file.txt" in the same folder where your code file is.
-> Compile and RUN your program.
